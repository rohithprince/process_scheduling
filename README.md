# process_scheduling
The give problem is based upon process scheduling of faculty and students, where they could enter the arrival time and burst time of their query. 
These queries can be compared to different processes in an operating system where each process needs resources and time for its execution.
These were handled by the CPU.In this problem sudesh sharma wants to dedicate fixed amount of time for each query of faculty and student.so,we use Round Robin method to solve this problem, by dividing the requests into two seperate categories ie,faculty queries and student queries.Then we solve the problem by allocating them required resources based upon their priorities.
input given from 1000 to 1200 i.e arrival time.
